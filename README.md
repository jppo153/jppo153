- 👋 Hi, I’m @jppo153
- 👀 I’m interested in startups, interface and game design, startup scalability, and company culture. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to become more technical (I have a business background) and learning how to create cohesive and efficient teams in the workplace. IOW, how to maintain motivation and cadence in high-performing teams.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on hackathons, semi-technical projects and meet new people
- 📫 Feel free to message me at jpaguaga153@gmail.com or 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a lucid dreamer - I remember most of my dreams and have certain agency in deciding what to dream about-
